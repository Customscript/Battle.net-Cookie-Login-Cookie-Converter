# Battle.net-Cookie-Login
Cookie Login Tool using Python
Got this from a Discord Server before it went public and owner ends up selling it to make profits. You get Cookie, and input into loader and open up Battle.net Launcher, then it logs you right in bypassing 2fa or authentication in general. You need to download python 3.9.0 and create set environmental path, and thats it. Thanks to Verity and Cystemz for making it free back then, and hope everyone else enjoys it.
